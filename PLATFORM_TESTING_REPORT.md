# 🔍 Platform Comprehensive Testing Report
**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Tester**: Claude Code  
**Platform**: AffiliateOS - "Shopify for Affiliate Sites"

## 📋 Executive Summary
The platform shows promise as a multi-tenant SaaS for affiliate sites, but has critical issues preventing it from being truly flexible and production-ready. While the core infrastructure exists, the onboarding flow is hardcoded for wearable tech only, database schema issues prevent site creation, and the platform lacks the flexibility expected from a "Shopify for affiliate sites."

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Onboarding Flow - BLOCKER**
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: Cannot create sites for any niche except wearable tech

#### Issues:
- ❌ **Hardcoded Niche Options**: Only shows wearable tech categories (Smartwatches, Fitness Trackers, etc.)
- ❌ **No Free Text Input**: Users cannot type their own niche (e.g., "pet supplies", "home decor", "golf equipment")
- ❌ **Database Schema Error**: Site creation fails with error:
  ```
  "Could not find the 'settings' column of 'tenants' in the schema cache"
  ```
- ❌ **No Affiliate Network Integration in Onboarding**: Missing option to connect existing affiliate accounts
- ❌ **No Product Import Options**: Cannot upload CSV/Excel with existing products

#### Required Fixes:
1. Add "Type Your Own Niche" text field
2. Add "What would you like to build?" open-ended question
3. Ask "Do you have existing affiliate relationships?" with multi-select:
   - Amazon Associates
   - ShareASale
   - CJ Affiliate
   - Rakuten
   - Impact Radius
   - Others (text input)
4. Add product import methods:
   - Upload CSV/Excel
   - Paste product URLs
   - API import from affiliate networks
   - Manual product entry

### 2. **Database Issues**
**Severity**: Critical  
**Impact**: Core functionality broken

#### Issues:
- ❌ **Missing `settings` column in `tenants` table**: Prevents site creation
- ❌ **Missing `insights_view` view**: Analytics dashboard fails with 500 error
- ❌ **Schema mismatch**: API expects columns that don't exist

### 3. **Navigation & Routing Issues**
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Confusing user experience

#### Issues:
- ❌ **Mixed tenant references**: Products link to `/nectarheat/products/` instead of current tenant
- ❌ **Broken links**: Multiple navigation items return 404
- ❌ **Inconsistent routing**: Some links use full URL, others use relative paths

### 4. **Missing Platform Features**
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Not truly multi-tenant SaaS
