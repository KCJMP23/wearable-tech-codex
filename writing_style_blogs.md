3. Lifecycle of a blog: 6-120 mos of. full-time work for busy traffic
4. Start small then grow, cover a small category with 10-100s then expand niches
5. Find a balance between competition, passion, and profitability; Complete guide on finding a niche (https://www.bloggersgoto.com/how-to-f…)
6. Launching
    1. Join Medium.com (start a WordPress website)
    2. Dreamhost.com, install WordPress
    3. Don’t put your niche keyword (choose a short, more arbitrary domain name) so you can expand
    4. About, Privacy Policy, Contact Us Page
    5. Spend as little time as possible on the site. get started
7. How to write a blog post - cater towards the niche and focus on solving problems, based on DATA
    1. Always use Google suggestions. Type “hot honey how to…” choose carefully, start targeting long-tail keywords (e.g., “how to choose tennis balls”)
    2. Make sure to open the search results for that topic, and use common sense while googling
    3. Google > search keywords > open the top 5-10, and pay attention to the characteristics and elements the site has. Include all of these and more to OUTPERFORM competitors. (e.g., the top blog post has 3000 words and 30 images, you want to write 5000 words and have 50 images). Google wants to suggest your blog as the best content on the entire internet.
    4. PROCESS
        1. #1 Provide Value - make it highly visual, easy to read, and easy to digest, so even a 10-year-old can read and understand it.
        2. You don’t need to be an expert and don’t pretend to be one. Act as if you are someone who is interested in this same topic.
        3. Include an image like an amateur, where it makes sense (e.g., if instructing someone to open up Google, show a screenshot of Google, draw illustrations, etc…) to break up text.
        4. Use a template: see video
        5. Become a trustworthy expert in this niche as you write (join communities, network, etc)
        6. The blog post must be unique and original and add to the topic (your unique take). you will never rank high on SEO as you are merely copying other posts. Solve problems in your own way.
        7. If time-sensitive, update from time to time, this can outrank your site
        8. Link related to one another and create infinite loops (only to provide additional value) to keep your visitor on your website as long as possible, providing maximum value.
    5. SEO
        1. Focus on content that gives value, and solves problems for people better than anyone than other blogs
    6. PROMOTION
        1. You do not need to promote the blog post anymore, Google will crawl the web
        2. Social media promotion
            1. Focus on creating value; answer a specific question that people have asked in a community or forum. At the end of the answer, leave a link.

        2. Affiliate marketing (see video) = Blogging
            1. partner with a company to promote products (tech/software = 30%)
            2. write a ton of content on the niche (cover the niche from A to Z), and target people who are close to making a purchase.
            3. Carefully write affiliate posts and then leave them to marinate in the search results. then add links after Google trusts the website
        3. Informational products = BEST $ on the internet
            1. Once you have studied the niche, put it all into a concise package and ship it to the customer
    8. Using AI - simply rephrases, it is not able to discuss like humans
        1. Ask AI to ask me questions so you can include everything
            1. PROMPT: I am writing a blog post on [TOPIC]. I want you to ask me any questions that a beginner may have on this topic.
        2. Summarize/shorten text: When overexplaining, ask it to be rephrased for a 15-year-old to understand.
        3. Use Grammarly
    9. Focus on building community and building trust.
    10. Tools: Grammarly, google suggestions, google trends (new/arising topics), sort by rising topics
