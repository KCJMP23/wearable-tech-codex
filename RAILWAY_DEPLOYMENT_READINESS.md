# Railway Deployment Readiness Checklist

## Current Status: ⚠️ NOT READY

### Critical Issues to Resolve

#### 1. ❌ Build Failures
- **Issue**: Production build failing due to server component imports
- **Error**: `You're importing a component that needs "next/headers"`
- **Location**: `packages/sdk/src/supabase/server.ts`
- **Action Required**: Fix server/client component separation

#### 2. ❌ Blockchain Package Build Errors
- **Issue**: TypeScript errors in blockchain package
- **Errors**: Multiple type mismatches in blockchain-service.ts
- **Action Required**: Either fix or exclude blockchain package from build

#### 3. ⚠️ Runtime Errors
- **Issue**: "exports is not defined" error
- **Impact**: Pages may fail to load
- **Action Required**: Remove experimental.esmExternals from next.config.mjs

### Completed Items ✅

#### Pages Created
- ✅ Features page with comparison table
- ✅ Pricing page with interactive toggle
- ✅ Examples page with success stories
- ✅ Resources page with documentation
- ✅ Login page with authentication form
- ✅ Start Trial page with multi-step registration
- ✅ Health check endpoint (/api/health)

#### Configuration Files
- ✅ railway.json configured
- ✅ nixpacks.toml created
- ✅ Environment variables documented
- ✅ Start/build commands defined

### Pre-Deployment Tasks

#### Must Fix Before Deploy:
1. **Fix Build Errors**
   ```bash
   # Current build command fails:
   pnpm build
   
   # Need to either:
   # 1. Fix server component issues
   # 2. Use --no-strict flag
   # 3. Build only web app
   ```

2. **Update package.json scripts**
   - Ensure `pnpm start` works for production
   - Add fallback build commands

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required env vars are set in Railway
   - Database URLs
   - API keys
   - Authentication secrets

### Recommended Actions

#### Option 1: Quick Fix (Bypass Issues)
1. Remove blockchain package from build
2. Fix server component imports
3. Remove experimental ESM config
4. Deploy with minimal features

#### Option 2: Proper Fix (Recommended)
1. Separate server and client components properly
2. Fix TypeScript errors in blockchain package
3. Test production build locally
4. Deploy after verification

### Deployment Commands

Once issues are resolved:

```bash
# Test locally first
pnpm build
pnpm start

# Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### Environment Variables Needed

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=
DIRECT_URL=

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

# APIs
OPENAI_API_KEY=
RAPIDAPI_KEY=

# Railway specific
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Summary

**Current State**: The application has all UI pages created and working in development mode, but is NOT ready for production deployment due to build failures.

**Blocking Issues**:
1. Server component import errors
2. Blockchain package TypeScript errors
3. ESM configuration issues

**Estimated Time to Deploy-Ready**: 1-2 hours of fixes needed

**Recommendation**: Fix the build errors first, then test locally with production build before attempting Railway deployment.
