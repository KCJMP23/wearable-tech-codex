## üèÜ Recommendations

### For Immediate Production Launch: **Railway.app**
**Why:** Fastest time to market with excellent developer experience, monorepo support, and reasonable pricing. Perfect for validating the SaaS model without DevOps overhead.

```yaml
# railway.toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
buildCommand = "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "pnpm start"
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
restartPolicyType = "on-failure"

[environments.production]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
```

### For Scale & Control: **DigitalOcean (Current)**
**Why:** You already have it set up, it provides full control, predictable costs, and can scale reasonably well with proper Docker/Kubernetes configuration.

### For Enterprise Scale: **AWS ECS/Fargate**
**Why:** When you reach 1000+ tenants and need enterprise features, compliance, and global scale. Wait until you have dedicated DevOps resources.

### For Cost Optimization: **Fly.io**
**Why:** Best price-to-performance ratio with edge deployment. Great when you have global customers and want to minimize latency.

## Migration Path Recommendation

### Phase 1: Launch (Now)
‚úÖ **Stay with DigitalOcean** - You've already invested in the setup
- Monitor costs and performance
- Set up proper monitoring (Datadog/New Relic)
- Implement auto-scaling with Docker Swarm

### Phase 2: Growth (10-50 tenants)
Consider **Railway** or **Render** if DevOps becomes a bottleneck
- Minimal migration effort
- Better developer productivity
- Lower operational overhead

### Phase 3: Scale (50-500 tenants)
Evaluate **Fly.io** for global performance or stay with DO + Kubernetes
- Add CDN (Cloudflare)
- Implement database read replicas
- Consider multi-region deployment

### Phase 4: Enterprise (500+ tenants)
Move to **AWS** or **GCP** for enterprise features
- Full infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Multi-region active-active deployment
- Enterprise support contracts

## Critical Factors for AffiliateOS

### Must-Haves
1. **Subdomain routing** - All platforms support this
2. **Redis caching** - All except Vercel provide this
3. **Background workers** - Railway, Render, DO, AWS excel here
4. **SSL certificates** - All provide free SSL
5. **External Supabase** - All can connect to external DBs

### Nice-to-Haves
1. **Global CDN** - AWS CloudFront, GCP Cloud CDN, Fly.io built-in
2. **Auto-scaling** - AWS, GCP, Render handle this best
3. **Preview environments** - Railway, Render, Vercel excel
4. **Zero-downtime deploys** - Render, Railway, Fly.io

---

## Final Verdict

**Current Best Choice:** Continue with DigitalOcean for now since it's already configured. Set up proper monitoring and prepare migration scripts.

**6-Month Target:** Migrate to **Railway** or **Render** when you hit 10+ paying tenants to reduce operational overhead.

**Long-term Vision:** AWS or GCP when you need enterprise features, compliance, and have dedicated DevOps resources.

### Cost Projection (Monthly)
```
0-10 tenants:     $88 (DigitalOcean)
10-50 tenants:    $150-250 (Railway/Render)
50-200 tenants:   $400-600 (Fly.io/Render)
200-1000 tenants: $800-2000 (AWS/GCP)
1000+ tenants:    $2000+ (AWS with enterprise support)
```

### Action Items
1. ‚úÖ Keep DigitalOcean setup as primary
2. üìã Create Railway account for staging environment
3. üìã Set up Cloudflare CDN ($20/mo) for static assets
4. üìã Implement health checks and monitoring
5. üìã Document deployment procedures for future migration
