## Technical Analysis

### JavaScript Bundle Analysis
The platform loads **150+ JavaScript chunks** during initial page load:
- Heavy dependency on Next.js framework chunks
- Multiple `@babel/core`, `@opentelemetry/api`, and `@playwright/test` dependencies
- Suggests potential for bundle optimization and code splitting

### Server Configuration
- **Port**: 3001 (non-standard, may cause confusion)
- **Response Time**: Server responds quickly (headers received promptly)
- **Content Security Policy**: Properly configured
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests

### Architecture Observations
- Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router
- Healthcare/medical imaging focused (based on imports: DICOM, medical device references)
- Multi-tenant architecture indicated
- Strong security headers implementation
