# Prompt for New Chat - Railway Deployment Fix

## Context
I have a Next.js 15.5.3 monorepo application that needs to be deployed to Railway. The application is an e-commerce/affiliate platform called AffiliateOS with a multi-tenant architecture. All UI pages are created and working in development mode, but the production build is failing.

## Project Structure
```
/Volumes/OWC Envoy Ultra/Projects/wearable-tech-codex-91625/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js 15.5.3 app (main deployment target)
│   └── worker/       # Background workers (not needed for initial deploy)
├── packages/
│   ├── sdk/          # Shared SDK with Supabase client

│   └── [other packages]
└── railway.json      # Railway deployment config
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- All frontend pages created and functional:
  - Homepage (/)
  - Features page (/features) with comparison table
  - Pricing page (/pricing) with monthly/annual toggle
  - Examples page (/examples) with success stories
  - Resources page (/resources) with documentation hub
  - Login page (/login) with social auth options
  - Start Trial page (/start-trial) with multi-step form
  - Health check API endpoint (/api/health)
- Railway configuration files created (railway.json, nixpacks.toml)
- Development server runs successfully on localhost:3000
- **Fixed server/client component separation** - Created client-safe SDK exports
- **Handled blockchain package errors** - Removed from main build
- **Removed experimental ESM config** - Cleaned up next.config.mjs
- **Fixed "self is not defined" error** - Added comprehensive polyfills
- **Build now compiles successfully** - `pnpm build` completes compilation phase

### ⚠️ Partial Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Build Warning Messages**
   ```
   - Edge Runtime warnings for process.versions (non-critical)
   - Some unhandled rejections during page data collection
   - Missing some manifest files (BUILD_ID needs manual creation)
   ```

2. **Production Start Issues**
   ```
   - Missing manifest files prevent clean `pnpm start`
   - Can be worked around by creating missing files manually
   - Railway deployment may auto-generate these during deploy
   ```

## Railway Configuration
The railway.json is configured with:
- Build command: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build`
- Start command: `cd apps/web && pnpm start`
- Health check: `/api/health`
- Region: us-west1

## Required Actions

### Priority 1: Fix Build Errors
1. **Fix server/client component separation**
   - The ValuationCalculator.tsx component is importing server-only code
   - Need to separate server utilities from client components
   - May need to create separate client/server versions of SDK functions

2. **Handle blockchain package**
   - Either fix TypeScript errors in blockchain package
   - OR exclude it from the main build (not needed for MVP)
   - Update build commands to skip problematic packages

3. **Remove experimental config**
   - Remove `experimental.esmExternals: 'loose'` from next.config.mjs
   - Fix any resulting module resolution issues

### Priority 2: Verify Production Build
1. Get `pnpm build` working locally
2. Test `pnpm start` with production build
3. Verify all pages load without errors
4. Check that API endpoints respond correctly

### Priority 3: Deploy to Railway
1. Ensure all environment variables are set
2. Deploy using Railway CLI or GitHub integration
3. Monitor deployment logs for any issues
4. Verify production site functionality

## Environment Variables Needed
```env
DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
RAPIDAPI_KEY=
```

## Files to Review
- `/apps/web/components/valuation/ValuationCalculator.tsx` - Has server import issue
- `/packages/sdk/src/supabase/server.ts` - Uses next/headers (server-only)
- `/packages/sdk/src/index.ts` - Exports both client and server code
- `/apps/web/next.config.mjs` - Has experimental ESM config
- `/packages/blockchain/src/blockchain-service.ts` - Has TypeScript errors

## Success Criteria
- [x] `pnpm build` completes without critical errors (✅ Compiles successfully)
- [x] `pnpm start` can run with workarounds (⚠️ Needs manifest files)
- [x] All pages created and functional in development
- [x] No "exports is not defined" errors (✅ Fixed)
- [ ] Successfully deploys to Railway (Ready to attempt)
- [x] Health check endpoint created (/api/health)
- [x] All interactive features work in dev mode

## Additional Context
- Using pnpm workspace monorepo
- Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router
- Supabase for backend
- React Query for data fetching
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Some pages were recently created to replace missing routes

## Request
Please help me fix the build errors and successfully deploy this application to Railway. Start by addressing the server component import issue, then handle the blockchain package errors, and finally ensure the production build works before deployment. The priority is getting a working deployment - we can exclude non-essential packages if needed.

## Previous Solution Attempts
- Tried adding exports polyfill (partially worked)
- Added ClientWrapper component (caused issues, was removed)
- Configured experimental.esmExternals (caused warnings)
- Attempted various build commands with different flags

Please provide a systematic approach to resolve these issues and achieve successful Railway deployment.
