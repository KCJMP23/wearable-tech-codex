## 🎯 Vision Statement
Transform the current single-niche platform into a true "Shopify for Affiliate Sites" - a multi-tenant SaaS that enables anyone to create profitable affiliate businesses in ANY niche within 5 minutes.

## 📐 Current Architecture Problems

### 1. **Routing Structure (CRITICAL)**
❌ **Current**: `localhost:3003/[tenantSlug]` - Tenant-first approach
✅ **Target**: 
```
localhost:3003/                    → Platform homepage
localhost:3003/signup              → User registration
localhost:3003/login               → User authentication
localhost:3003/dashboard           → Multi-site control center
localhost:3003/sites/[siteId]     → Individual site management
localhost:3003/marketplace         → Themes & plugins
localhost:3003/analytics          → Cross-site analytics
localhost:3003/billing             → Subscription management
[custom-domain.com]               → Actual affiliate sites
```

### 2. **Hardcoded References to Remove**
Search and replace ALL instances of:
- `wearable`, `wearables`, `wearable-tech`
- `smartwatch`, `fitness tracker`, `health monitor`
