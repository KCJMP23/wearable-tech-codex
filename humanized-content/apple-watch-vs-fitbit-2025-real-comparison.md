# Apple Watch vs Fitbit 2025: I Tested Both for 3 Months (Honest Review)

Look, I'm not here to write another generic tech comparison. I bought both the new Apple Watch Series 10 and Fitbit Charge 6 with my own money and wore them for three months. One on each wrist, like some kind of wearable tech maniac.

Here's what actually matters.

## The Real-World Battery Life Story

Apple claims "all-day battery life" for the Watch Series 10. That's technically true if your day is exactly 18 hours and you don't use it much. In practice:

- **Morning workout**: Lost about 15% battery from a 45-minute run with GPS
- **Regular day use**: Checking messages, weather, timer - down to 60% by lunch
- **Sleep tracking**: Forget it. You'll need to charge overnight

The Fitbit Charge 6? I charged it twice in three months. Seriously. It just keeps going.

## Heart Rate: The Accuracy Test

I tested both against a chest strap during workouts. Here's what I found:

**During steady cardio** (like jogging): Both were within 2-3 BPM of the chest strap. Good enough.

**During strength training**: The Apple Watch jumped around like crazy. The Fitbit stayed more consistent but still got confused during push-ups.

**Resting heart rate**: Both tracked this well over time.

## The App Situation

Apple Watch wins here, but not how you'd think. It's not about having more apps - most watch apps are terrible anyway. It's about the integration.

When I get a text, I can actually respond from the Apple Watch. With the Fitbit, I just see it and then have to find my phone anyway.

## Sleep Tracking Reality Check

The Fitbit is better at this, hands down. It automatically detects when you fall asleep and wake up. The Apple Watch... well, you have to remember to turn on sleep mode. I forgot about 40% of the time.

The Fitbit also gives you a sleep score that actually helps you understand your sleep quality. Apple's sleep data feels more like a report card you can't do anything about.

## Price vs Value

- **Apple Watch Series 10**: $429 for the 46mm GPS version
- **Fitbit Charge 6**: $159 (often on sale for $129)

The Apple Watch costs nearly 3x more. Is it 3x better? No.

Is it better? In some ways, yes. But the Fitbit does 80% of what most people need for 37% of the price.

## Who Should Buy What

**Get the Apple Watch if:**
- You're deep in the Apple ecosystem
- You want to respond to messages from your wrist
- Battery life doesn't stress you out
- You have $400+ to spend

**Get the Fitbit if:**
- You primarily want fitness tracking
- Battery anxiety is real for you
- You want accurate sleep data
- You prefer simplicity over features

## The Bottom Line

After three months, I kept wearing both. The Apple Watch on weekdays for the convenience, the Fitbit on weekends and for sleep tracking.

If I had to choose just one? The Fitbit Charge 6. It does the most important stuff really well without constantly needing attention.

But honestly, the best wearable is the one you'll actually wear every day. And for most people, that's probably the one that doesn't die before lunch.

## FAQ

**Q: Can you shower with both devices?**
A: Yes, both are water resistant. I wore them in the shower regularly without issues.

**Q: Which has better GPS accuracy?**
A: Practically identical for running routes. Both were within a few meters of each other.

**Q: Do you need a phone plan for GPS models?**
A: No, GPS models work independently for location tracking. You only need cellular plans for the LTE versions.

**Q: Which works better for women's health tracking?**
A: The Fitbit has more comprehensive cycle tracking and doesn't require additional apps.

**Q: Can you use third-party watch faces?**
A: Apple Watch has way more options through the App Store. Fitbit's selection is limited but adequate.
