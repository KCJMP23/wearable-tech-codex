# Fitbit Charge 6 Review: 6 Months Later, Here's What Nobody Tells You

Six months ago, I switched from an Apple Watch to the Fitbit Charge 6. Everyone said I was crazy. Today, I'm writing this review on my laptop while the Fitbit tracks my typing as "active minutes." 

Make of that what you will.

## What Still Works Great

**The battery life is stupid good.** I charge it every Sunday while I meal prep. That's it. The freedom from daily charging is real.

**Sleep tracking just works.** It knows when I fall asleep watching Netflix on the couch (embarrassing but accurate). The sleep score actually helps me connect how I feel to how I slept.

**Stress notifications aren't annoying.** When it buzzes for a breathing reminder, I usually need it. It's not constant nagging like some devices.

## What Started Bothering Me

**The GPS takes forever to connect.** Sometimes I'm already three blocks into my run before it finds satellites. In a city with tall buildings? Good luck.

**The heart rate sensor gets confused easily.** During weight lifting, it thinks I'm either dead (60 BPM) or having a heart attack (180 BPM). There's no middle ground.

**The Google Pay situation is weird.** It works, technically. But it's slower than just using my phone and half the time the cashier doesn't know what's happening.

## The Real Talk on Accuracy

I tested it against my doctor's equipment during checkups:

- **Resting heart rate**: Spot on
- **Blood pressure**: Doesn't measure this (despite what some online listings claim)
- **Steps**: Close enough for motivation purposes
- **Calories burned**: Probably inflated, but consistently inflated

## Daily Life Reality

**Morning routine**: Check overnight stats while coffee brews. Sleep score, resting heart rate, any notifications I missed.

**Workouts**: Start the exercise mode, ignore the heart rate spikes during weights, trust the GPS eventually kicks in for runs.

**Work day**: Occasional move reminders that I ignore. Stress notifications that I actually follow.

**Evening**: Check if I hit my step goal (usually yes), see how my stress levels tracked (usually accurate).

## Things That Broke or Annoyed Me

**The band started fraying** around month 4. Fitbit replaced it for free, but still.

**Syncing occasionally fails** and I have to restart the tracker. Happens maybe once a week.

**The always-on display isn't actually always on.** It dims significantly in bright sunlight.

## Is It Worth $159?

I paid $159. Amazon has it for $129 pretty regularly. At $129? Absolutely worth it.

At $159? Still probably worth it if you want:
- Reliable fitness tracking
- Excellent battery life
- Good sleep data
- Simple interface

## Who Shouldn't Buy This

**If you want smartwatch features**, get a smartwatch. This is a fitness tracker that happens to show notifications.

**If you do a lot of strength training**, the heart rate tracking will frustrate you.

**If you're impatient**, the GPS connection time will drive you nuts.

## Six Month Verdict

Would I buy it again? Yes.
Would I recommend it? Depends on what you want.
Will I upgrade when the Charge 7 comes out? Probably not, unless the GPS improves significantly.

The Fitbit Charge 6 does fitness tracking really well. It's not trying to be everything to everyone. For what it is, it's solid.

Just don't expect miracles from a $150 device.

## Real User Questions

**Q: Does it work with Android and iPhone equally well?**
A: Yes, but setup is slightly easier on Android due to Google integration.

**Q: Can you answer calls on it?**
A: No, it only shows call notifications. You need your phone to answer.

**Q: How waterproof is it really?**
A: I've showered, swum, and gotten caught in rain storms. No issues.

**Q: Does the Premium subscription matter?**
A: It comes with 6 months free. I didn't renew. The free features are plenty for most people.

**Q: Is the screen too small?**
A: For fitness data, it's fine. For reading full text messages, you'll squint.
